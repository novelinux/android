## /proc/[pid]/stat

              Status information about the process.  This is used by ps(1).
              It is defined in the kernel source file fs/proc/array.c.

              The fields, in order, with their proper scanf(3) format speci‐
              fiers, are listed below.  Whether or not certain of these
              fields display valid information is governed by a ptrace
              access mode PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS | PTRACE_MODE_NOAUDIT
              check (refer to ptrace(2)).  If the check denies access, then
              the field value is displayed as 0.  The affected fields are
              indicated with the marking [PT].

              (1) pid  %d
                        The process ID.

              (2) comm  %s
                        The filename of the executable, in parentheses.
                        This is visible whether or not the executable is
                        swapped out.

              (3) state  %c
                        One of the following characters, indicating process
                        state:

                        R  Running

                        S  Sleeping in an interruptible wait

              (7) tty_nr  %d
                        The controlling terminal of the process.  (The minor
                        device number is contained in the combination of
                        bits 31 to 20 and 7 to 0; the major device number is
                        in bits 15 to 8.)

              (8) tpgid  %d
                        The ID of the foreground process group of the con‐
                        trolling terminal of the process.

                        The kernel flags word of the process.  For bit mean‐
                        ings, see the PF_* defines in the Linux kernel
                        source file include/linux/sched.h.  Details depend
                        on the kernel version.

                        The format for this field was %lu before Linux 2.6.

              (10) minflt  %lu
                        The number of minor faults the process has made
                        which have not required loading a memory page from
                        disk.

              (11) cminflt  %lu
                        The number of minor faults that the process's
                        waited-for children have made.

              (12) majflt  %lu
                        The number of major faults the process has made
                        which have required loading a memory page from disk.

              (13) cmajflt  %lu
                        The number of major faults that the process's
                        waited-for children have made.

              (14) utime  %lu
                        Amount of time that this process has been scheduled
                        in user mode, measured in clock ticks (divide by
                        sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).  This includes guest time,
                        guest_time (time spent running a virtual CPU, see
                        below), so that applications that are not aware of
                        the guest time field do not lose that time from
                        their calculations.

              (15) stime  %lu
                        Amount of time that this process has been scheduled
                        in kernel mode, measured in clock ticks (divide by
                        sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).

              (16) cutime  %ld
                        Amount of time that this process's waited-for chil‐
                        dren have been scheduled in user mode, measured in
                        clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).  (See
                        also times(2).)  This includes guest time,
                        cguest_time (time spent running a virtual CPU, see
                        below).

              (17) cstime  %ld
                        Amount of time that this process's waited-for chil‐
                        dren have been scheduled in kernel mode, measured in
                        clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).

              (18) priority  %ld
                        (Explanation for Linux 2.6) For processes running a
                        real-time scheduling policy (policy below; see
                        sched_setscheduler(2)), this is the negated schedul‐
                        ing priority, minus one; that is, a number in the
                        range -2 to -100, corresponding to real-time priori‐
                        ties 1 to 99.  For processes running under a non-
                        real-time scheduling policy, this is the raw nice
                        value (setpriority(2)) as represented in the kernel.
                        The kernel stores nice values as numbers in the
                        range 0 (high) to 39 (low), corresponding to the
                        user-visible nice range of -20 to 19.

                        Before Linux 2.6, this was a scaled value based on
                        the scheduler weighting given to this process.

              (19) nice  %ld
                        The nice value (see setpriority(2)), a value in the
                        range 19 (low priority) to -20 (high priority).

              (20) num_threads  %ld
                        Number of threads in this process (since Linux 2.6).
                        Before kernel 2.6, this field was hard coded to 0 as
                        a placeholder for an earlier removed field.

              (21) itrealvalue  %ld
                        The time in jiffies before the next SIGALRM is sent
                        to the process due to an interval timer.  Since ker‐
                        nel 2.6.17, this field is no longer maintained, and
                        is hard coded as 0.

              (22) starttime  %llu
                        The time the process started after system boot.  In
                        kernels before Linux 2.6, this value was expressed
                        in jiffies.  Since Linux 2.6, the value is expressed
                        in clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).

                        The format for this field was %lu before Linux 2.6.

              (23) vsize  %lu

              (24) rss  %ld
                        Resident Set Size: number of pages the process has
                        in real memory.  This is just the pages which count
                        toward text, data, or stack space.  This does not
                        include pages which have not been demand-loaded in,
                        or which are swapped out.

                        mal number.  Obsolete, because it does not provide
                        information on real-time signals; use
                        /proc/[pid]/status instead.

              (32) blocked  %lu
                        The bitmap of blocked signals, displayed as a deci‐
                        mal number.  Obsolete, because it does not provide
                        information on real-time signals; use

                        The bitmap of ignored signals, displayed as a deci‐
                        mal number.  Obsolete, because it does not provide

                        /proc/[pid]/status instead.

              (34) sigcatch  %lu
                        The bitmap of caught signals, displayed as a decimal
                        number.  Obsolete, because it does not provide
                        information on real-time signals; use

                        Scheduling policy (see sched_setscheduler(2)).
                        Decode using the SCHED_* constants in linux/sched.h.

                        The format for this field was %lu before Linux
